# Synopsis:
# Test the test runner Docker image by running it against a predefined set of 
# solutions with an expected output.
# The test runner Docker image is built automatically.

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected test results against the actual test results
# generated by the test runner Docker image.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh

# Stop executing when a command returns a non-zero return code
set -e

# Create an internal network to not have wine wait for a while when
# getting the local IP address
docker network inspect internal > /dev/null 2>&1 || docker network create --internal internal

# Build the Docker image
docker build --rm -t exercism/batch-test-runner .

# Run the Docker image using the settings mimicking the production environment
# TODO: figure out to use --read-only
time docker run \
    --rm \
    --network internal \
